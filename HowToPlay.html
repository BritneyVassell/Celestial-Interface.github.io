			    <li> Players are given 60 seconds to answer each question correctly.</li>

                <li> The player selects one of the five categories displayed on the upper row of the board, and any one of the dollar values.

                   		For example, if the player chooses "Animals" for $200, the answer revealed would be about animals and the amount of money 
						that could be won or lost would be $200. Generally, the higher the dollar value, the greater the degree of difficulty. </li>

                <li>The value card is removed, and the question attached to the card is revealed at the top of the screen via a window alert. </li>
				
				<li>The player must then, within the time limit, type their answer to the question being asked into their browser. </li>
